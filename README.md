# Analysis

Question 1 - Does the term length of the president impact the number of federal emergencies declared in the United States?
We found that the term length of the president does NOT impact the number of federal emergencies declared in the US. The correlation between the 2 factors was 0.42, which does not imply a strong relationship. See Kernel #12 for scatter plot. 

Question 2 - Does the term length of the president impact the duration of federal emergencies declared in the United States?
We found that the term length of the president does NOT impact the duration of federal emergencies declared in the US. The correlation between the 2 factors was 0.19 (after removing extreme values), which does not imply a strong relationship. See Kernel #19 for scatter plot. 

Question 3 - Does the political party of the president impact the number of federal emergencies declared in the United States?
We found that the political party of the president does NOT impact the number of federal emergencies declared in the US. Democratic Presidents averaged 58.5 declarations per year, while republican presidents averaged 49.5 declarations per year. We believe these averages are too close to imply a strong relationship. See Kernel # 24 for summary dataframe. 

Question 4 - Has the number of disasters declared by FEMA risen or fallen over time?
We found that generally, the number of disasters declared by FEMA has risen over time, despite a slight decrease in declarations after ~2005. The correlation between the Year and the number of declarations declared each year was 0.72. We believe this implies a slight relationship. See Kernel #28 for scatter plot.
